# RapidBay

Rapid bay is a self hosted video service/torrent client that makes playing videos from torrents as easy as:

1. Opening the webapp on a phone/laptop/tablet/smartTV.
2. Searching for content.
3. Selecting desired video file.
4. Waiting for Download/Conversion.
5. Playing on the device or cast to AppleTV/Chromecast

## Setting up Jackett as a search backend:

Rapidbay requires the torrent indexer [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) for searching.
Have a look [here](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett#installation-using-docker) on how to set it up using Docker.

There's also a [docker-compose example](https://github.com/hauxir/rapidbay/blob/master/docker-compose.example.with.jackett.yml) file to show how you can connect rapidbay and jackett together.

## Running:

Requires Docker

```
docker run -p 5000:5000 -e JACKETT_HOST="http://your.jacket.host" -e JACKETT_API_KEY="YourAPIKey" hauxir/rapidbay
```

App will be running at http://localhost:5000

## Subtitles

You'll need a VIP account at OpenSubtitles.org for it to work:
```
-e OPENSUBTITLES_USERNAME=someusername -e OPENSUBTITLES_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```
### Configuring which subtitles to download:

The default setting downloads english subtitles.

Add the env variable SUBTITLE_LANGUAGES to your docker params like so to get more languages:

```
-e SUBTITLE_LANGUAGES="['en', 'de', 'es']"
```

## Require a password:

Add the env variable PASSWORD to your docker params like so to prompt for a password when opening rapidbay:

```
-e PASSWORD=YOURPASSWORD
```

## Registering as a handler for any magnet link:

-   Go to https://\<RAPIDBAY_HOST\>/registerHandler and it should prompt you to register your running RapidBay instance as a default handler for torrent links on any torrent site!
-   You can also copy/paste a magnet link directly into the search bar to open magnet links manually.

## Developing

Requires Docker + docker-compose

```
docker-compose up
```
